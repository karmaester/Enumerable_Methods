# Enumerable Methods

> Methods built:
- my_each
- my_each_with_index
- my_select
- my_all?
- my_any?
- my_none?
- my_count
- my_map_block
- my_map_proc
- my_inject

> Test suite:

- Test cases for each method built with Rspec

### Setup Rspec

> We have already created multiple files `player_spec.rb` and `table_spec.rb`, if you want to create another one with the end *`[your file name]`*`_spec.rb`
- Open `player_spec.rb` or `table_spec.rb` file
- Open a terminal window and type `rspec`
- If all test were passed you will see:
